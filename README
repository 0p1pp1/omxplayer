Compiling :

You need the content of your sdcard somewhere mounted or copied.
There might be development headers to install on the running PI system
for the crosscompiling.

Edit Makefile.include and change the settings according your locations.

You can also compile it on the PI the native way ;)

Run : 

  make ffmpeg
  make
  make dist

Installing :
  copy over omxplayer-dist/* to the PI /
